Nearly every attendee was attending their first hackathon. They created nearly 50 innovative projects, which were judged by [some of the coolest people in Chicago](https://windyhacks.com/#judging).

Though Chicago is the third-largest city in the US, Windy City Hacks was one of the only high school hackathons in the city all year. We set a new precedent for what making looks like for Chicago youth.
